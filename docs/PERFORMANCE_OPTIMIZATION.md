# HyperServe Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Performance Benchmarks

Based on our benchmarks (10,000 requests, 100 concurrent connections):

### Basic GET Performance
- **Go**: 35,290 req/sec (2.83ms avg latency)
- **Rust**: 37,817 req/sec (2.64ms avg latency) ✅ **7% faster**

### JSON Endpoint
- **Go**: 35,992 req/sec (2.78ms avg latency) 
- **Rust**: 35,701 req/sec (2.80ms avg latency) 
- Nearly identical performance

### POST with Payload
- **Go**: 36,709 req/sec (2.72ms avg latency) ✅ **10% faster**
- **Rust**: 33,324 req/sec (3.00ms avg latency)

### High Concurrency (500 connections)
- **Go**: 24,739 req/sec ✅ **48% better**
- **Rust**: 16,681 req/sec ⚠️ **Needs optimization**

## Rust Performance Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Profiling and Analysis (Priority: High)
1. **Profile under load** using tools like `perf`, `flamegraph`, or `cargo-profiler`
2. **Identify bottlenecks** in the current thread pool implementation
3. **Analyze lock contention** and synchronization overhead
4. **Measure memory allocation patterns** under high concurrency

### Phase 2: Thread Pool Optimization (Priority: High)
1. **Optimize work stealing** algorithm
2. **Reduce lock contention** in job queue
3. **Implement better load balancing** across threads
4. **Consider using `crossbeam` channels for job distribution

### Phase 3: Consider Async Architecture (Priority: Medium)
1. **Evaluate async/await** with `tokio` or `async-std`
2. **Implement epoll/kqueue** based event loop
3. **Compare with current thread-per-connection model
4. **Ensure zero-dependency constraint is maintained**

### Phase 4: Additional Optimizations
1. **Memory pool** for request/response objects
2. **Zero-copy optimizations** for large payloads
3. **CPU affinity** for worker threads
4. **NUMA awareness** for multi-socket systems

## Implementation Guidelines

### Safety First
- No unsafe code without thorough review
- Maintain zero-dependency philosophy
- Extensive testing under load
- Regression testing for all optimizations

### Benchmarking Protocol
1. Use consistent hardware/OS for all tests
2. Warm up servers before benchmarking
3. Test with various payload sizes
4. Test with different concurrency levels (100, 500, 1000, 5000)
5. Monitor CPU, memory, and file descriptor usage

### Success Metrics
- Match or exceed Go performance at 500+ connections
- Maintain sub-3ms latency at p99
- Zero failed requests under normal load
- Linear scaling up to CPU core count

## Next Steps

1. Set up profiling infrastructure
2. Create load testing scenarios
3. Implement incremental optimizations
4. Document performance improvements
5. Share findings with the community
