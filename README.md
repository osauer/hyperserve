# HyperServe

HyperServe lets humans and AI assistants co-manage the same production-grade Go services. A zero-dependency, high-performance core ships with native Model Context Protocol (MCP) control surfaces and hardened defaults so you can automate safely from laptop to regulated environments.

## Features

- üß± **Project Scaffold** - Generate secure, MCP-ready services via `hyperserve-init`
- üöÄ **Minimal Dependencies** - Only 1 dependency (`golang.org/x/time`)
- ü§ñ **MCP Support** - Built-in Model Context Protocol for AI assistants
- üîå **WebSocket Support** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security Middleware** - Hardened headers, auth, and rate limiting ready to enable
- üìä **Observable** - Metrics, health checks, and structured logging
- ‚ö° **High Performance** - Optimized for throughput and low latency
- üîß **Battle-tested HTTP/2** - Leverages Go's excellent standard library

## Quick Start

```go
srv, _ := hyperserve.NewServer()
srv.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello, World!")
})
srv.Run()
```

## Scaffold a New Service

```bash
go install github.com/osauer/hyperserve/cmd/hyperserve-init@latest
hyperserve-init --module github.com/acme/payments
cd payments
go run ./cmd/server
```

Flags include `--name` (display name), `--out` (output directory), `--with-mcp=false` to opt out of MCP, and `--local-replace` for working against a local HyperServe checkout during development.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/osauer/hyperserve
```

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

HyperServe includes native MCP support, enabling AI assistants to:
- Execute tools and access resources
- Connect via HTTP or Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Discover capabilities automatically

Enable MCP with environment variables:
```bash
HS_MCP_ENABLED=true
HS_MCP_SERVER_NAME=MyServer
HS_MCP_SERVER_VERSION=1.0.0
```

Or programmatically:
```go
srv, _ := hyperserve.NewServer(
    hyperserve.WithMCPSupport("MyServer", "1.0.0"),
    hyperserve.WithMCPBuiltinTools(true),
    hyperserve.WithMCPBuiltinResources(true),
)
```

### Common Middleware

`NewServer` wires in recovery, request logging, and metrics collectors.
Security middleware (headers, auth, rate limiting) can be enabled per route:

```go
srv, _ := hyperserve.NewServer()
srv.AddMiddleware("/api", hyperserve.RateLimitMiddleware(srv))
srv.AddMiddlewareStack("/web", hyperserve.SecureWeb(srv.Options))
```
