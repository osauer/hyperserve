# hs ðŸš€

_A simple, dependable, and dependency-free HTTP srv for the hyperspeed age._

hs is a Go-based HTTP srv designed to handle requests, serve responses, and enforce rate limitsâ€”all while avoiding
external dependencies. With default configurations, clean middleware handling, and basic endpoint checks, hs is ready to
roll with just a few lines of Go.

## Features

- **Middleware Support**: Easily add and chain middleware functions to extend srv functionality.
- **Rate Limiting**: Configure requests per second and burst limits to keep things under control.
- **Configurable**: Load configurations from environment variables, a JSON file, or rely on built-in defaults.
- **Health Checks**: `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/livez` endpoints for easy liveness and readiness probing.
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Because who needs them, really?
